Raid.it
=======

A guild raiding and events calandar.

This project was put together as an experiment to understand why Rails applications seem to always devolve into massively coupled, difficult-to-maintain messes of code. Starting from scratch using ideas from talks and discussions with workmates and friends, I went through the process of building an application where each step was explicitly the opposite of what normally happens in a Rails application.

I blogged my thoughts and process under the series "Designing a Rails App". The posts are as follows:

* [Designing a Rails App Part 1](http://jasonroelofs.com/2012/05/29/designing-a-rails-app-part-1/)
* [Rules for Rails App Development](http://jasonroelofs.com/2012/06/05/rules-for-rails-app-development/)
* [Abstract Persistence Logic](http://jasonroelofs.com/2012/07/13/abstract_persistence_logic/)
* [Naming is Everything](http://jasonroelofs.com/2012/10/01/naming-is-everything/)
* [Implementing Persistence](http://jasonroelofs.com/2013/01/28/implementing-persistence/)
* [RaidIt: Final Thoughts](http://jasonroelofs.com/2013/02/11/raidit-final-thoughts/)

This project is complete and I don't plan on any more updates to this repository.
